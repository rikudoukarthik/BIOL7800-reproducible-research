### Complete this activity as a `qmd` file and email the source code, along with the rendered `html`, to Gaurav before class on 04 Feb 2025.

- Save the [`.qmd` source code](https://gitlab.com/gklab/teaching/reproducible-research-s25/-/raw/main/activities/activity-1.qmd) for this file to your local directory.  
- Edit the document with your responses to the questions, and render the document into an `html` file.
- Email the source `qmd` file as well as the rendered `html` to Gaurav. 

*Note: if all else fails, you can send this activity to me as a Word or PDF file.*

*Grading*: Each paper (or dataset, for undergraduate students) you describe is worth 5 points.

## Instructions for graduate students

Ideintify *five primary research papers* that you feel are important for you to know inside-and-out as part of your dissertation research, and which you feel might be good candidates for our course [semester project](semester-project/overview.qmd). For each paper, complete the following information: 

:::{.callout-note}

- Full article citation: 

- In your own words, describe (a) what was the motivation for this study; (b) what data the authors generated to address their question; (c) how the data were analyzed (both in terms of what approaches, and what code/statistical packages); and (d) how the results from this paper shape your work. 

- Have the authors made the data and/or code available as supplemental materials or through public repositories? If so, please include a link to the data. 

- What steps would you have to take to reproduce 1--2 key results from this paper?

## Instructions for undergraduate students

Identify five biological datasets from [this repository](https://retriever.readthedocs.io/en/latest/datasets_list.htm)^[If nothing here interests you, you are welcome to explore additional data archives through [this link](https://libguides.cmich.edu/lifesciencedata/ecological)] that you would like to explore in your semester project. For each of the five datasets, address the following questions: 

:::{.callout-note}

- Name and source of dataset: 

- Why was this dataset originally collected? (I.e. what questions were the authors exploring when collecting these data?)

- What is the type of data available? Describe both the technical features of the files (e.g. "a CSV table with 10 columns and 950 rows"), and the contents themselves (e.g. "columns 2 and 3 describe the latitude and longitude; column 4 describes the species name, [...]")

- Brainstorm 1--2 figures that you would like to create with these data.^[If you are stuck, consider exploring the [R graph gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/) to explore different ways to visualize data]
