Think for yourself:

- Who do you expect to collaborate with during your research program?
- Across how many institutes, countries, languages, and disciplines can you envision collaborating?

# Using `renv`

Two ways to initiate:

- Either when starting new project, select "use renv with this project"
- `renv::init()`

The process would be as follows:

- When working in a project with `renv`, cannot load packages with `library()` before running `renv::install()` first.
- Once installed, other users automatically get the same versions cemented in the renv files:
  - `renv::snapshot()` cements everything.
  - When others pulling, to make sure of access to all required packages, `renv::activate()`.
