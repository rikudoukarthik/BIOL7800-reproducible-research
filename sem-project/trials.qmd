Their dataset is only available on TROPICOS, but since it is connected to GBIF ([Tropicos MO Specimen Data](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/7bd65a7a-f762-11e1-a439-00145eb45e9a)), I can try using `rgbif` to access it. However, I have some questions about the fields I will be able to access.

```{r}
library(rgbif)

tropicos <- occ_search(datasetKey = "7bd65a7a-f762-11e1-a439-00145eb45e9a",
                       )
```
