# Reproducible research (and open science) in ecology and evolution

Repo for the Spring 2025 edition of Reproducible Research in Ecology and Evolution by Gaurav Kandlikar at LSU.

## Course objectives

The content and structure of this course is designed to help you work towards the following objectives: 

1. Understand the trends and tools for reproducible and open research practices in science generally, and in ecology/evolutionary biology specifically; 

2. **Develop and articulate your individual philosophy and workflow towards reproducible research**; 

3. Integrate openly available datasets and tools to reproduce classic result(s); 

4. Envision and begin to implement the steps you will take towards ensuring reproducibility and robustness of your own research; 

5. **Build a community of practice^[*Communities of practices* are "groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly." -- [ref](https://www.wenger-trayner.com/introduction-to-communities-of-practice/)] around reproducible and open research in ecology and evolution**.

Of these, the objectives I resonate with the most have been highlighted in bold. While not necessarily new to implementing tools and approaches for reproducible/open science into my own work, something that I've not yet been able to do is precisely articulate a personal rhetoric for implementing such workflows, and also demonstrate efficiently yet convincingly enough how to move from theory to practice and why it is important to do so.

Plenty of general information exists on this topic already, but I wish to distill this into something tangible of my own flavour. This would be a secondary semester project for me, and by the end of the semester I will hopefully have a well-articulated manifesto that I can post on my webpage and point people to in my evangelistic pursuits.
